# The +AdyenNotification+ class handles notifications sent by Adyen to your servers.
#
# Because notifications contain important payment status information, you should store
# these notifications in your database. For this reason, +AdyenNotification+ inherits
# from +ActiveRecord::Base+, and a migration is included to simply create a suitable table
# to store the notifications in.
#
# Adyen can either send notifications to you via HTTP POST requests, or SOAP requests.
# Because SOAP is not really well supported in Rails and setting up a SOAP server is
# not trivial, only handling HTTP POST notifications is currently supported.
#
# @example
#    @notification = AdyenNotification.log(request)
#    if @notification.successful_authorisation?
#      @invoice = Invoice.find(@notification.merchant_reference)
#      @invoice.set_paid!
#    end
